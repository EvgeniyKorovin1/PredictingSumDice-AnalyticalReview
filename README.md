# PredictingSumDice-AnalyticalReview
This project, you can see the completion of a test task for the position of Data Scientist. The task is devoted to the assessment and analysis of an unusual cashback program from one of the players in the banking market. During the analysis, a discrete random variable "Sum of values ​​on the dice" is introduced. The most optimal strategy for participating in this promotion is determined. A calculation is made of the maximum amount of winnings that a player can receive, after which the data is compared with the offers of other players on the market and conclusions are made about the effectiveness of participation in the program.
